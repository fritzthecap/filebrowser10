Rudimental Version handling
---------------------------

FileBrowser Version is stored at one single place: The MANIFEST.MF
Version in showed on commandline and as frame title, also within TreeEdit (About).
 
implemented with version 10.1.0
 
Drag and drop improvements
--------------------------
 
Drag'n drop should be improved allowing drag and drop single and multi file selections between FileBrowser windows.
Communication with other system applications should work im best case.
Move/Copy option should be choosen with using [ctrl] key (not with a little drag down menu). Default is move.
