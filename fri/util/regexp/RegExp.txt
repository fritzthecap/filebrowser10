File Browser Configuration:
---------------------------

    The File Browser configuration file for
        - word bounds definition and
        - alternating separator
    is in
        fri/util/regexp/RegExpUtil.properties

    If you need to have localized word bounds characters other
    than "[^:alnum:_]" you can put it there and restart the browser.


Escaping Characters In Search Pattern
-------------------------------------

    If you choose "No Regular Expressions", the only character you must
    escape is "|" (or the character you wrote in RegExpUtil.properties
    as "alternatingCharacter"). Escaping is done by backslash: "\|".



EXCERPT FROM GNU-REGEXP DOCUMENTATION:
======================================

Within a regular expression, the following characters have special meaning:

    Positional Operators
    --------------------

        ^ matches at the beginning of a line
        $ matches at the end of a line
        \A matches the start of the entire string
        \Z matches the end of the entire string

    One-Character Operators
    -----------------------

        . matches any single character
        \d matches any decimal digit
        \D matches any non-digit
        \n matches a newline character
        \r matches a return character
        \s matches any whitespace character
        \S matches any non-whitespace character
        \t matches a horizontal tab character
        \w matches any word (alphanumeric) character
        \W matches any non-word (alphanumeric) character
        \x matches the character x, if x is not one of the above listed escape sequences.

    Character Class Operator
    ------------------------

        [abc] matches any character in the set a, b or c
        [^abc] matches any character not in the set a, b or c
        [a-z] matches any character in the range a to z, inclusive
        A leading or trailing dash will be interpreted literally.

    Within a character class expression, the following sequences have special meaning if
    the syntax bit RE_CHAR_CLASSES is on:

        [:alnum:] Any alphanumeric character
        [:alpha:] Any alphabetical character
        [:blank:] A space or horizontal tab
        [:cntrl:] A control character
        [:digit:] A decimal digit
        [:graph:] A non-space, non-control character
        [:lower:] A lowercase letter
        [:print:] Same as graph, but also space and tab
        [:punct:] A punctuation character
        [:space:] Any whitespace character, including newline and return
        [:upper:] An uppercase letter
        [:xdigit:] A valid hexadecimal digit

    Subexpressions and Backreferences
    ---------------------------------

        (abc) matches whatever the expression abc would match, and saves it as a
              subexpression. Also used for grouping.
        (?:...) pure grouping operator, does not save contents
        (?#...) embedded comment, ignored by engine
        \n where 0 < n < 10, matches the same thing the nth subexpression matched.

    Branching (Alternation) Operator
    --------------------------------

        a|b matches whatever the expression a would match, or whatever the expression b
            would match.

    Repeating Operators
    -------------------
    These symbols operate on the previous atomic expression. 

        ? matches the preceding expression or the null string
        * matches the null string or any number of repetitions of the preceding expression
        + matches one or more repetitions of the preceding expression
        {m} matches exactly m repetitions of the one-character expression
        {m,n} matches between m and n repetitions of the preceding expression, inclusive
        {m,} matches m or more repetitions of the preceding expression

    Stingy (Minimal) Matching
    -------------------------
    If a repeating operator (above) is immediately followed by a ?, the repeating operator
    will stop at the smallest number of repetitions that can complete the rest of the match.
